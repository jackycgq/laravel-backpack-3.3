# License
Backpack is **free for non-commercial use**, **but developers** or companies **who make money using it** - for themselves, their employers or their clients, **need to [purchase a commercial license](https://backpackforlaravel.com/pricing)** to prevent “unlicensed use” notification bubbles and interruption of service.

  "body": "**If you’re just trying Backpack on localhost, you don’t need a license code.** You only need to purchase a license code, or request a non-commercial one, when you take your application to production."
}

Also, if you’ve contributed to Backpack with code or time, please [let us know](https://backpackforlaravel.com/contact) and we’ll be happy to give you free commercial licenses - we’re so grateful for all the community members that have been kind enough to pitch in, and help make Backpack better.

# Support
With thousands of developers using Backpack, mostly non-commercial, **we can’t offer official support for the packages**. We actively maintain the packages, we try to squash any bugs ASAP and add new features all the time, but we unfortunately can't spend time on back-and-forth on implementation issues in your project. But we do have a clear documentation and have been blessed with a **great community**, where people help each other out. If Backpack becomes your tool of preference, I highly recommend you join our gang. Help others get started, create cool stuff, or influence the direction of Backpack: 

- **[StackOverflow tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/backpack-for-laravel) for support requests** (If you need help creating something using Backpack, post your question on StackOverflow using the ```backpack-for-laravel``` tag. We've been blessed with a great community, that is happy to help. We all like StackOverflow points.)
- **[Gitter Chatroom](https://gitter.im/BackpackForLaravel/Lobby) for quick questions** (If you have an urgent matter that won't take much time to answer, use our 24/7 Gitter chatroom. Be considerate, everyone's probably working on their own project right now.)
- **[Github Issues](https://github.com/laravel-backpack/) for bugs** (Found a bug? Great! Please search for it on Github first - someone might have already found it. If not, open an issue, we're happy to learn about it and make Backpack better. )
 
Thank you for sticking up with me for so long. This is the last Backpack lesson I can give you. **Now you have absolutely no excuse not to start your first Backpack project :-)** Here are a few links for if you still don't think you're ready:

- [Go through the demo](https://laravel-backpack.readme.io/v3.3/docs/demo) and play around
- Read this guide: [CRUD - How to use (full example)](https://laravel-backpack.readme.io/v3.3/docs/crud-example)
- Study the [CrudController API Cheat Sheet](https://laravel-backpack.readme.io/v3.3/docs/crud-full-api). There are features you'll only find here. Can you spot them?
