Here are some other cool things Backpack makes easy for you. I heavily recommend you go through them one by one, just browsing. You might not need the feature now, but when you do you’ll know how to find it.

- [Reordering and nesting items](https://laravel-backpack.readme.io/v3.3/docs/advanced-features#section-reordering-and-nesting-items) (hierarcy)
- [Manage files on disk](https://laravel-backpack.readme.io/v3.3/docs/advanced-features#section-media-library-file-manager) (media library)
- In list view, you can add a “+” button next to each entry, to allow the admin to easily preview some quick information that was too big to fit inside a columns - we call it [details row](https://laravel-backpack.readme.io/v3.3/docs/advanced-features#section-details-row)
- Track all modifications to an entry and easily revert them - [revisions](https://laravel-backpack.readme.io/v3.3/docs/advanced-features#section-revisions)
- Export your list view items by adding [export buttons](https://laravel-backpack.readme.io/v3.3/docs/advanced-features#section-export-buttons)
- [Fake fields](https://laravel-backpack.readme.io/v3.0/docs/advanced-features#section-extras-fake-fields-stored-as-json-in-the-database)
- Translatable models and [multi-language CRUDs](https://laravel-backpack.readme.io/v3.3/docs/advanced-features#section-translatable-models-and-multi-language-cruds)
- [Tabs in create/update forms](https://laravel-backpack.readme.io/v3.3/docs/advanced-features#section-tabbed-forms)
- [inline errors](https://laravel-backpack.readme.io/v3.3/docs/advanced-features#section-inline-errors) in create/update forms

Additionally, here are a few more ways you can customize your CRUDs:
- [Custom Views for each CRUD](https://laravel-backpack.readme.io/v3.3/docs/advanced-features#section-customize-views-for-each-crud-panel)
- [Custom CSS or JS](https://laravel-backpack.readme.io/v3.3/docs/advanced-features#section-custom-css-and-js-for-crud-operations) for each CRUD Operation
- [Extra CRUD routes](https://laravel-backpack.readme.io/v3.3/docs/advanced-features#section-extra-crud-routes)
- [Custom Search Logic](https://laravel-backpack.readme.io/v3.3/docs/advanced-features#section-custom-search-logic-in-table-view) in List View

**That’s it for today!** Told you we’re done with long lessons :-) Hopefully some of the above have peaked your interest and you’ve clicked to see what Backpack can do. In the next lesson we’ll go through a few other Backpack packages, that cover some recurring use cases.
