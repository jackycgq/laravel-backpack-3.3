Apart from Base and CRUD, we’ve developed an ecosystem of single-purpose packages, each designed to fix one simple problem. Here’s a list of all our packages right now:

Core Packages:
- Base - provides the layout (blade files, html and js);
- CRUD - provides the logic for all CRUD operations;

Ready-built CRUDs:
- PermissionManager - interface to manage users & permissions;
- Settings - interface to edit site-wide settings;
- PageManager - CRUD for custom pages, using page templates;
- MenuCRUD - manage menu items
- NewsCRUD - manage articles, categories and tags

Extensions:
- LangFileManager - interface to edit Laravel language files;
- LogManager - interface to preview Laravel log files;
- BackupManager - interface to backup your files & db;

**That’s it for today!** If you’re ever in need, remember we got you covered :-) In the next lesson we’ll explain the Backpack YuMMy License and how you can interact with the Backpack community.
