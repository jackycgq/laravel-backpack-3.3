 ###Help Backpack as a whole
Check out [Backpack's waffle board](https://waffle.io/Laravel-Backpack/crud). Depending on how much time you have, you can help by:
- responding or evaluating issues in the New Issues column;
- create pull requests with fixes for issues in the Ready column;

###Help a specific Backpack package
Tasks are stored in Github Issues, for each Backpack project. So if you want to help out a specific package, that's where to look:
- [Backpack\Base Issues](https://github.com/Laravel-Backpack/base/issues) - high priority
- [Backpack\CRUD Issues](https://github.com/Laravel-Backpack/crud/issues) - high priority
- [Backpack\PermissionManager Issues](https://github.com/Laravel-Backpack/permissionmanager/issues)
- [Backpack\LangFileManager Issues](https://github.com/Laravel-Backpack/langfilemanager/issues)
- [Backpack\Settings Issues](https://github.com/Laravel-Backpack/settings/issues)
- [Backpack\Generators Issues](https://github.com/Laravel-Backpack/generators/issues)
- [Backpack\PageManager Issues](https://github.com/Laravel-Backpack/pagemanager/issues)
- [Backpack\LogManager Issues](https://github.com/Laravel-Backpack/logmanager/issues)
- [Backpack\BackupManager Issues](https://github.com/Laravel-Backpack/backupmanager/issues)
- [Backpack\MenuCRUD Issues](https://github.com/Laravel-Backpack/MenuCRUD/issues)
- [Backpack\NewsCRUD Issues](https://github.com/Laravel-Backpack/NewsCRUD/issues)

Please consider solving the issues in this order: URGENT, BUG, HELP WANTED, then anything else.

1. Claim that issue in Github (just saying "I'm on it" in the conversation will do).
2. Fork the package.
3. [Use your fork](https://snippets.khromov.se/composer-use-your-own-fork-for-a-package/) instead of the main package.
4. Push any modifications to your fork's Github repo.
5. [Make a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) so your fork's modifications can be pulled into the main package.
