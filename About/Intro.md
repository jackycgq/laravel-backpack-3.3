Backpack v3.3 is a collection of packages for Laravel 5.5. You can use them to build custom admin panels fast, for anything from presentation websites to complex web applications. 

After getting to know Backpack, you'll be able to create a CRUD panel for each entity in just a few steps:

```bash
# STEP 1. create migration
php artisan make:migration:schema create_tags_table --model=0 --schema="name:string:unique"
php artisan migrate

# STEP 2. create a model, a request and a controller for the admin panel
php artisan backpack:crud tag #use singular, not plural

# STEP 3. manually add this to your routes.php file (under the admin prefix and admin middleware):
# CRUD::resource('tag', 'TagCrudController');
# 
# For example:
# Route::group(['prefix' => config('backpack.base.route_prefix'), 'middleware' => ['admin'], 'namespace' => 'Admin'], function()
# {
#    CRUD::resource('tag', 'TagCrudController');
# });
```

After that, you can customize it to your liking/specifications, use advanced features, etc.
